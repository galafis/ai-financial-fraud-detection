# Models

Machine learning models for fraud detection.

## Files

- `ensemble_model.py` — `FraudDetectionEnsemble` class that loads and combines predictions from multiple sub-models (Random Forest, XGBoost, neural network, autoencoder, meta-learner).

## Sub-directories

| Directory | Status |
|---|---|
| `ensemble/` | Placeholder — `__init__.py` only |
| `supervised/` | Placeholder — `__init__.py` only |
| `unsupervised/` | Placeholder — `__init__.py` only |
| `training/` | Placeholder — `__init__.py` only |

Each sub-directory currently contains only an `__init__.py`. The core ensemble logic lives in `ensemble_model.py` at this level.
